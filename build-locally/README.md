# Build ZMK firmware locally

## Introduction

I want to build firmwares locally, I cannot be waiting for github actions for every single things I want to test out.

## Structure

We are using stable version of ZMK's image to build both left and right firmwares.
Build itself is more or less a replica of what github actions do anyway.
